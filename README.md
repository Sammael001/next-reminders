## RMA Reminders App

I built this app to sort, organize and track Return Merchandise Authorizations for my current employer.

The app sorts and color-codes reminders by their due dates, and features an at-a-glance summary view as well as a detailed view of each reminder. 

Reminder data is saved to local browser storage. The app also allows users to download their stored reminder data in JSON format, then reupload the data into local storage.

This app was created with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and create-next-app, and uses React Hooks. [DayJS](https://day.js.org/) is used for date parsing and manipulation.
